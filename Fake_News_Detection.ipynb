            "Description: In 2017, Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin privately during the G20 summit. Reports later revealed that Trump took the interpreter’s notes and told them not to share details, not even with his own administration. This sparked outrage in Washington, as past presidents usually kept detailed records of such meetings. From 2017 to 2019, Trump held at least five private talks with Putin without full official records. In 2019, two watchdog groups sued the State Department, accusing then–Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of violating federal records law for failing to preserve the Hamburg meeting notes. The notes were never recovered. With Trump and Putin set to meet in Alaska on August 15, the 2017 secrecy is back in focus.\n",
